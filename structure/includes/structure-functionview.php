<p><strong>Education Blurb</strong>: Hemoglobin is the protein that transports oxygen in the blood. It is an allosteric protein that changes shape when it binds to oxygen. This structure shows the form with oxygen bound to all four subunits. (Citation: David Goodsell, <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/101/motm.do?momID=41">MOTM #41</a>)</p>
